    "* **Step 3 Data visualization** - plotting couple of charts, just to visualize the downloaded data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Step 4 Train machine learning models** - training couple of machine learning regression models to check which one of them fits the best - is it a correlaction between climate (temperature, percipitation) and prices of soft wheat.\n",
